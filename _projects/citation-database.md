The [Citation Database](https://yale-fortunoff.github.io/citationdb/) is
a React-based web application developed for the
[Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies](https://fortunoff.library.yale.edu/)
at Yale, in partnership with the [Yale Digital Humanities Lab](https://dhlab.yale.edu/projects/citation-database/). I was the primary developer on this project.

The interface links published works that cite Fortunoff material and the video
testimony itself, on the archive's online video access system,
[Aviary](https://fortunoff.aviaryplatform.com/).
