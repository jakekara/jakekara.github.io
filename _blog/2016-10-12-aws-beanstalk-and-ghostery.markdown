Ghostery blocks assets from crazy AWS beanstalk endpoints.

Other malware/adware/tracker blockers probably do the same. 

I spent half a day pulling my hair out over this, so I'm posting an
admission of my own stupidity as a public service.

If your css and JS assets aren't loading when you're testing a Beanstalk
service, just turn off Ghostery. That's it.
