I wrote a command-line utility to create a virtual TODO file by concatenating
directory-level TODO files.

* Here's [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/jakekara/big-todo)
* Here's [the PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/big-todo/)

Documentation can be found in the GitHub repo, so I won't reproduce it here.

The [code](https://github.com/jakekara/big-todo/blob/master/btodo/__init__.py)
is just one 47-line .py file. It makes use of an interesting package called
[glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html), which handles recursively finding all of the TODO files with the following one-liner:

<code>glob(os.path.join(parent, f"**/{basename}"))</code>
