I wrote a CLI tool to print the covid-era date.

Code and installation instructions are available [on Github](https://github.com/jakekara/covid-date).

In Covid times, each day is one year, so running it on July 7 results in the following output. 

Usage example:

```bash
$ covid-date
Covid Year 111
```

If your Covid era began on a different era, you can add a configuration file to your home directory (instructions available in the GitHub repo).
