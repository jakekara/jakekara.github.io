I only accept secure messages.

If you want to send me a secure, one-way encrypted message, go [to my
keybase page](https://keybase.io/encrypt#jakekara), type your message and
hit encrypt. Then email me that blob of digital gibberish. It will be
encrypted using my public key -- meaning only I can decrypt it with my
private key.

However, if you want to send me an encrypted email I can respond to, I'll
need your encryption key -- which you might not have yet. The easiest way
for a non-techy person to do this is with the browser plugin
[Mailvelope](https://www.mailvelope.com/en). 

You can also message me on [Signal](https://signal.org/download/) if you
have my phone number if you prefer messaging.
