I'm Jake Kara. I'm a data editor at [CTMirror.org](//ctmirror.org) and its
data site [TrendCT.org](//trendct.org), which means I'm a programmer and a
journalist. I write code to collect, analyze, and visualize data for the
web.

I'm also studying computer science through [Harvard Extension
School](https://www.extension.harvard.edu). I'll complete my [Software
Engineering graduate
certificate](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/professional-graduate-certificates/software-engineering-certificate)
by May 2017. I plan on writing a post about Harvard Extension School, but
suffice it to say, it's legit, even if it doesn't have the prestige-factor
of being accepted into Harvard's other schools. That's where the Extension
school differs from Harvard's other schools: you don't need to apply
through a competitive process. If you meet the basic requirements, such as
having a bachelor's degree, you can take classes and receive graduate
credit. They're the same Harvard classes that students at Harvard
Collegetake and they're not easy.

Before I was a data editor, I was a plain-old editor, running a
newspaper. Before that, I was a reporter, and before that I studied
professional writing in college.
