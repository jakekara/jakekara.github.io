I'm Jake kara. I'm a software engineer at The Washington Post.

Before that I worked at Yale University Library, in both the [Digital Humanities Lab](https://dhlab.yale.edu) and the [Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimony](https://fortunoff.library.yale.edu/).

I earned my master's degree in software engineering from [Harvard Extension School](https://www.extension.harvard.edu). I completed my [Software Engineering graduate certificate](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/professional-graduate-certificates/software-engineering-certificate). My thesis was on extending Jupyter Notebooks with a syntax for cell-level metadata, called Margo Notes.

Before I started working at Yale, I was a data editor at [CTMirror.org](//ctmirror.org) and its data site [TrendCT.org](//trendct.org). Before that, I was a plain-old editor, running a newspaper. Before that, I was a reporter, and before that I studied professional writing in college.

### Fediverse

* Find me on Mastodon at <a rel="me" href="https://twit.social/@jakek">@jakek@twit.social</a>.
* You can follow *this website itself* on the Fediverse because I'm working on implementing ActivityPub features. So far I only have tested it out on Mastodon. Copy and paste @jakekara@jakekara.com into the search in your Fediverse client and click follow. It might take a little while for the Follow to be accepted because I have to do it manually for now.
