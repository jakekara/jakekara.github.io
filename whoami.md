I'm Jake Kara. I'm a developer and I work at Yale University Library, in bot the [Digital Humanities Lab](https://dhlab.yale.edu) and the [Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimony](https://fortunoff.library.yale.edu/).

I'm also studying computer science through [Harvard Extension School](https://www.extension.harvard.edu). I completed my [Software Engineering graduate certificate](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/professional-graduate-certificates/software-engineering-certificate) in May 2017, and I am working towoard a Master's degree.

Before I started working at Yale, I was a data editor at [CTMirror.org](//ctmirror.org) and its data site [TrendCT.org](//trendct.org).

Before I was a data editor, I was a plain-old editor, running a newspaper. Before that, I was a reporter, and before that I studied professional writing in college.
