My code blog has a new style.

* The previous, terminal-themed code-blog is archived here: [https://jakekara.github.io/jakekara.github.io-2016/](https://jakekara.github.io/jakekara.github.io-2016/)

### The old style

I'm very proud of the old style, which I made to look exactly like my
Terminal window when I'm using emacs, but it's not what I'm feeling right
now. It was exactly what I was feeling last year.

The command line has always been magic to me, the heart and soul of a
computer. The GUI just gets in the way. I've always loved the idea that if
I knew how to talk to it, the computer would do exactly what I asked of
it.

This is a feeling that companies like Google, Amazon and Apple are all
trying to bring to users through voice-based assistants: Give me a command
and I'll execute it. Unfortunately voice assistants are far from perfect,
but the command line has always been perfect, as long as you're willing to
learn the language.

### The new style

Maybe because I'm getting older, I'm all about readability. I look back at
my older posts, and the harsh light-on-dark, monospace design doesn't
showcase my words. It's too challenging for me, so I doubt anyone else
would bother to get past it.

I've borrowed excellent ET-Book (ET for Edward Tufte) font, [available
on Tufte's github
site](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/tree/gh-pages/et-book).
