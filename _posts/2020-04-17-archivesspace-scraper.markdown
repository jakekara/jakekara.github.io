I wrote a tool for making local copies of ArchivesSpace repositories.

- [Here it is on GitHub](https://github.com/jakekara/archives-space-scraper)

ArchivesSpace is a relational database application used for library catalogs at Yale University Library, where I work in the [Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimony](https://fortunoff.library.yale.edu/).

This makes local copies of JSON endpoints. This was handy for a data analysis project that required all of the data for the Fortunoff Video Archive's collection, so that I didn't have to keep requesting it from the ArchivesSpace server.
