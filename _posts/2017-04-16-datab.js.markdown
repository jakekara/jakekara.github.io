I wrote a js library for transforming tabular data in javascript, and generating editable HTML tables.

Some cool features:

* You can bind a file input element to create a datab.data object and call a callback function  when a user chooses a .csv
* You can generate a save-able CSV file blob for the user to download at any point
* In addition to generating CSV files, you can also generate editable HTML tables, JSON objects and JS objects that represent your datab.data object
* When you generate an HTML table, and you make some alterations using datab's built-in edit modes (transpose/add/drop cols), the internal data of the object can also be synched to incorporate those changes.
* You can create a datab.js from JSON, a JS object, a CSV file or a CSV string
* You can transpose a table and add and drop columns

Features I want to add:

* DOC-U-MEN-TATION, with lots of cool demos

Here's the repo: [https://github.com/jakekara/datab.js](https://github.com/jakekara/datab.js)

Here's a modest demo [https://jakekara.github.io/datab.js/demo/](https://jakekara.github.io/datab.js/demo/)

It's specifically not styled at all to show you that datab.js doesn't care. I don't want it to be opinionated at all or rely on CSS, or conflict with your CSS.

#### A more interesting demo: Building a map

Here's a demo of a map-making tool, using datab.js: [https://jakekara.github.io/ct-color-map/](https://jakekara.github.io/ct-color-map/)

This is the kind of thing I do all the time working in a newsroom. You supply it a CSV with a column for town names a column of colors (RGB/A HEX or named web colors) and it will color the map. Here's [a sample CSV](https://github.com/jakekara/ct-color-map/blob/master/sample_data.csv) you can "upload" to it (it doesn't ever leave your local machine.

#### How I'm using it

I'm working on a project that deals with a lot of tabular data -- ingesting it into a database and displaying it in a web app. datab has been my swiss army knife for this project.

#### How I plan to use it, or how you might want to use it

* I'd love to write a node CLI tool for manipulating tabular data, or generating web graphics from spreadsheets
* I have a table-maker demo, complete with a download button that generates a fully self-contained, single-file HTML chart that you can iframe or pym.js-embed into your pages
* Anywhere I need tables from data, I'm going to start using this.
