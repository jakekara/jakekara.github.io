I wrote some code to get the latest Connecticut bear sightings.

I wanted to try out Pandas' .read_html() method in order to turn html
tables into dataframes.

The code downloads the latest count of reported bear sightings for every town in
Connecticut from [this CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection
(DEEP) page](http://www.depdata.ct.gov/wildlife/sighting/bearsight.asp) and
turns it into a DataFrame and exports .csv.
