It downloads the latest count of reported bear sightings for every town in Connecticut from [this CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) page](http://www.depdata.ct.gov/wildlife/sighting/bearsight.asp).

First I wrote it as its own class, then I rewrote it in as few lines as possible:
