<p>I made to try out Pandasâ€™ .read_html() method in order to turn html tables into dataframes.</p>

<p>It downloads the latest count of reported bear sightings for every town in
Connecticut from <a href="http://www.depdata.ct.gov/wildlife/sighting/bearsight.asp">this CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection
(DEEP) page</a> and
turns it into a .csv.</p>
