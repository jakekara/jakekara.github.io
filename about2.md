I'm Jake Kara. I'm a data editor at [CTMirror.org](//ctmirror.org) and its
data site [TrendCT.org](//trendct.org), which means I'm a programmer and a
journalist. I write code to collect, analyze, and visualize data for the
web.

I'm also studying computer science through [Harvard Extension
School](https://www.extension.harvard.edu). I completed my [Software
Engineering graduate
certificate](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/professional-graduate-certificates/software-engineering-certificate)
by May 2017. 

Before I was a data editor, I was a plain-old editor, running a
newspaper. Before that, I was a reporter, and before that I studied
professional writing in college.
