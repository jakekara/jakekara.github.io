I help researchers in the humanities, journalism and other fields answer
research questions and tell stories through computation and custom web
development. Reach out to me at [hey@jakekara.com](mailto:hey@jakekara.com).

## 📈 Data viz, explainers, interactives

Interactive, web components you can embed in your site or mobile app.

## ⚡️ Static web apps

Full-on, story-driven web sites with one or more pages and no backend, which
makes them virtually free to keep online forever.

## 🥞 Full-stack development

Sometimes a backend database or application server is necessary.  

## 📜 Data processing and interrogation

Data never comes in the format you want it, and it's rarely as clean as you'd
hope. I can help with every stage of obtaining, cleaning, validating and
restructuring data to answer your research questions. Some examples include:

* Scraping data from websites and APIs
* Extracting data from PDFs, unstructured or semi-structured documents  
* Building databases or flat-file structured data
* Interrogating data with reproducible, documented computational methodology

## About me

* I work at Yale's Digital Humanities Lab, and before that I was a data journalist.
* I only take on projects that allows me to follow the ethics that govern
  journalism and academic research.  
* I like writing software that answers questions and tells stories.  
* I like working on a variety of different projects, all up and down the technology "stack."  
* I have a master's degree in software engineering.
* I'm learning to play acoustic guitar, now that I'm done with that master's degree!
