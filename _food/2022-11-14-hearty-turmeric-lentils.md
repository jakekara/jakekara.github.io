type: recipe
ingredients: 
  - 1 cup split red lentils
  - 4 medium yellow potatoes, diced small
  - 1 small yellow onion, diced
  - 4 cups liquid (e.g. 3 chicken stock + 1 water)
  - 1 can tomato paste
  - 1 can full fat coconut milk
  - 4 cups frozen spinach
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tbsp turmeric
  - 1 tsp curry powder
  - 1 tsp ground ginger
  - 1 tsp cumin
  - 1 tsp chili powder
  - 1/8 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/8 tsp onion powder
  - salt to taste
  - pepper to taste
  - splash of red wine vinegar for serving
directions:
  - Heat oil in a large dutch oven. Add onions and saute about 5 minutes. Add potato and saute about 5 minutes.
  - Add tomato paste. Fill can with water and let it sit for a minute, stir and add to dutch oven. Cook for a couple of minutes and add seasonings (turmeric, curry powder, cumin, chili powder, onion powder, ginger, garlic powder, salt and pepper).
  - Add a total of four cups of liquid. In my case I used a cup of water and three cups of frozen chicken stock. Substitute wine for the cup of water, whatever. Add lentils and bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir often.
  - Add coconut milk and simmer another 20 minutes or until lentils and tomatoes are cooked through. Stir often.
  - Add frozen spinanch and stir. Cook until all of the frozen spinach has cooked, just a few minutes. Serve with a splash of vinegar.
notes:
  - Stir the lentils often; they really seem to settle on the bottom and burn easily.
  - This really thickens up, so you could probably add more than 4 cups of stock, or add more when you reheat it.

This one is very flexible, so just omit what you don't have or don't like. This is a very hearty but still bright tasting soup. Nice and filling in the winter.
